# Aave Protocol – Lending Market Analysis

## Overview
Aave is a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol that allows users
to supply assets to earn yield and borrow against collateral. It is one of
the largest and most battle-tested lending protocols in DeFi.

## How Aave Works
Users can deposit supported assets into liquidity pools and receive interest
based on utilization rates. Borrowers can take loans by overcollateralizing
their positions, with interest rates that can be stable or variable.

## Yield Strategies
- Supplying stablecoins during high utilization periods
- Using conservative LTV ratios to avoid liquidations
- Combining lending with other DeFi strategies to optimize capital efficiency

## Risk Analysis
- Smart contract risk
- Liquidation risk due to price volatility
- Interest rate fluctuations
- Oracle dependency

## When to Use Aave
Aave is suitable for users seeking relatively conservative DeFi yield with
high liquidity, transparency, and strong risk parameters.

## Personal Notes
I actively use Aave for lending strategies and portfolio diversification,
focusing on capital preservation and controlled risk exposure.
